# MNIST-digits-classification
Problem Statement: MNIST Digit Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. This dataset has been a benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, especially in the field of image classification.

Objective:
Develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and categorizing the digits.
